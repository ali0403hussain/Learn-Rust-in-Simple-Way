# Rust  How to Compile and Execute Rust Program

* If there is a single program file we can use rustc [name_of_source_file].
* If multiple files and program is bigger with many dependencies then use Cargo
    * cargo new [dir_name] -> Creating/ new project in directory
    * cargo run -> compile and execute program.
    * cargo build -> only build program but not run
    * cargo build --release -> build for production (with optimization)
