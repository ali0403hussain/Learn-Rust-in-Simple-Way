# Primitive Data Types
* Integers
    * Unsigned integers are positive integers
        * start with u and then number of bits 
        * e.g. usigned_num: u8 = 5;
        * Types u8, u16, u32, u64 and u128
    * Signed integers are both positive and negative integers
        * start with i and then number of bits 
        * e.g. signed_num: i8 = -5;
        * Types i8, i16, i32, i64 and i128
* Float
    * Numbers with decimal places.
    * start wif f and then number of bits.
    * Types f32 and f64.
*  Plateform Specific integers
    * usize -> pointer sized unsigned integers
    * isize -> pointer sized signed integers.
* Character
    * Single character can be defined by char keyword.
* Boolean
    * Boolean value can be defined by bool keyword.
* Type aliasing
    * New name for an existance type
    * Defined by type keyword then name and then value.
* Type Conversion
    *  Type conversion can be used by keyword as.
